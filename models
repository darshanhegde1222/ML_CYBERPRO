You trained and evaluated four models:

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

XGBoost

Now I’ll explain the code along with what each part does, and how it relates to each model in your cybersecurity classification task.

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from xgboost import XGBClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, f1_score
🔹 What this does:

Imports necessary libraries:

pandas for handling data

train_test_split to divide dataset into train and test

StandardScaler to normalize features

4 models: RandomForest, SVM, KNN, XGBoost

Metrics: Accuracy and F1 score for evaluation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
data = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/dataset.csv')
X = data.drop('label', axis=1)
y = data['label']
🔹 What this does:
Loads your cybersecurity dataset from CSV.

X = features (like packet size, IP address, etc.)

y = target labels (like "malicious", "benign", or attack categories)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
🔹 What this does:

Splits the dataset:

80% for training

20% for testing

random_state=42 ensures reproducibility

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
🔹 What this does:

Scales your features to standard normal distribution (mean = 0, std = 1)

Especially important for SVM and KNN (sensitive to scale)

🔍 1. Random Forest

rf_model = RandomForestClassifier()
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
rf_preds = rf_model.predict(X_test)
Creates and trains the Random Forest model

.predict() applies the model on test data

📌 Internally:

Builds many decision trees

Takes majority vote for final classification

🔍 2. SVM (Support Vector Machine)

svm_model = SVC()
svm_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
svm_preds = svm_model.predict(X_test)
Trains the SVM model

Finds the best hyperplane to separate classes

📌 Internally:

Uses kernel tricks (RBF by default) to map data to higher dimensions

🔍 3. K-Nearest Neighbors

knn_model = KNeighborsClassifier()
knn_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
knn_preds = knn_model.predict(X_test)
Trains KNN (lazy learner)

For each test sample, it looks at K nearest points and takes the majority label

📌 Internally:

Uses Euclidean distance to find “neighbors”

🔍 4. XGBoost

xgb_model = XGBClassifier(use_label_encoder=False, eval_metric='logloss')
xgb_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
xgb_preds = xgb_model.predict(X_test)
Trains the XGBoost model

Uses boosting — builds new trees that fix the mistakes of the previous ones

📌 Internally:

Handles overfitting well with regularization

Very fast and accurate

📊 Evaluation (Same for all models)

rf_acc = accuracy_score(y_test, rf_preds)
rf_f1 = f1_score(y_test, rf_preds, average='weighted')
Repeat for svm_preds, knn_preds, and xgb_preds.

accuracy_score: % of correct predictions

f1_score: balance of precision and recall, especially good for imbalanced classes

📋 Final Output

print("Random Forest Accuracy:", rf_acc, "F1 Score:", rf_f1)
print("SVM Accuracy:", svm_acc, "F1 Score:", svm_f1)
print("KNN Accuracy:", knn_acc, "F1 Score:", knn_f1)
print("XGBoost Accuracy:", xgb_acc, "F1 Score:", xgb_f1)
Compares the performance of all 4 models

You can then decide which is best for your final report or deployment

All the models you trained are supervised machine learning classifiers. That means:

You give them labeled data (features and a label like "malicious" or "benign").

They learn patterns from the training data.

Then, they try to predict the label of unseen/test data.

🔍 1. Random Forest Classifier
✔️ What it is:
An ensemble model that builds multiple decision trees.

It combines the results of all trees to make the final prediction (majority vote).

🔍 How it helps:
Good for imbalanced or noisy data.

Handles both numerical and categorical features.

Can detect important features (like IP address frequency, packet length).

📊 Use Case in Cybersecurity:
Detecting suspicious patterns like:

High-frequency requests from an IP

Sudden spike in traffic

Malicious packet sequences

🔍 2. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
✔️ What it is:
SVM finds the best line or boundary (hyperplane) that separates different classes.

Works well in high-dimensional space.

🔍 How it helps:
Effective when the classes are clearly separable (e.g., attack vs. normal).

Works well with smaller datasets.

📊 Use Case in Cybersecurity:
Binary classification of packets (e.g., intrusion vs. normal)

Detecting DoS or phishing attacks

🔍 3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
✔️ What it is:
Instance-based learning: It stores the training data and classifies new points based on the K nearest neighbors.

🔍 How it helps:
Very simple and intuitive

Good when the structure is based on proximity or similarity

📊 Use Case in Cybersecurity:
Classifying new network connections based on similarity to known ones

Works well for anomaly detection

🔍 4. XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
✔️ What it is:
A powerful boosting algorithm.

Builds trees sequentially, each correcting the errors of the previous one.

🔍 How it helps:
Often delivers very high accuracy

Handles missing values, noisy data, and large feature sets

📊 Use Case in Cybersecurity:
Real-time detection of advanced persistent threats (APTs)

Highly accurate malware classification

📈 What They Predict
These models learn from features like:

IP addresses

Packet size, duration

Protocol types (TCP, UDP, etc.)

Flags and service usage

And then predict:

Is the packet/connection malicious or benign?

What type of attack is it? (e.g., DoS, PortScan, etc.)

🎯 Final Use in Project
You:

Trained and evaluated each model

Compared performance (Accuracy, F1 Score)

Can now select the best performing one and deploy it in your intrusion detection or traffic analysis system
